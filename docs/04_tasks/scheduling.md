## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Initial Schedule

1. Calculate minimum trips required
2. Determine basic headways
3. Assign preliminary bus types
4. Create base timetable

### Phase 2: Resource Allocation

1. Match buses to trips
2. Assign drivers
3. Plan maintenance slots
4. Position backup resources

### Phase 3: Schedule Refinement

1. Adjust for peak demands
2. Optimize connection times
3. Add express services
4. Fine-tune stop timing

### Phase 4: Validation

1. Check capacity constraints
2. Verify driver rules
3. Confirm maintenance windows
4. Test schedule resilience

## Implementation Plan

### Preparation Steps

1. Data collection and validation
2. Resource inventory
3. Constraint verification
4. Stakeholder consultation

### Execution Steps

1. Generate initial schedules
2. Test and simulate
3. Adjust and optimize
4. Document and communicate

### Monitoring Steps
