# Financial Models

## Capital Investment Models

### Vehicle Acquisition

```
Total Cost = Σ(Units × Unit Cost + Configuration Cost + Delivery Cost)
ROI = (Annual Benefits - Annual Costs) / Total Investment
Depreciation = (Purchase Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
```

### Infrastructure Development

```
Total Cost = Base Construction + Equipment + Installation + Project Management
Annual Maintenance = 3% of Total Cost
ROI Period = Total Cost / Annual Benefits
```

### Technology Systems

```
Initial Investment = Hardware + Software + Integration + Training
Annual Subscription = Licenses + Support + Updates
TCO = Initial Investment + Σ(Annual Costs × 5 years)
```

## Operating Cost Models

### Vehicle Operations

```
Cost per Kilometer = (Fuel + Maintenance + Labor + Insurance) / Total Kilometers
Daily Cost = Fixed Costs + (Cost per Kilometer × Daily Kilometers)
Monthly Cost = Daily Cost × Operating Days + Overhead
```

### Route Economics

```
Route Cost = Distance × Cost per Kilometer + Staff Cost + Station Cost
Revenue = Passengers × Average Fare
Profit = Revenue - Route Cost
Break-even Point = Fixed Costs / (Revenue per Trip - Variable Cost per Trip)
```

### Maintenance Costs

```
Preventive Maintenance = Labor Hours × Rate + Parts + Consumables
Corrective Maintenance = Repair Costs + Downtime Costs
Total Maintenance = Preventive + Corrective + Overhead
```

## Revenue Models

### Fare Structure

```
Base Fare = Operating Cost / Average Passengers + Profit Margin
Zone Premium = Base Fare × Zone Factor
Peak Hour Premium = Base Fare × 1.25
Special Service = Base Fare × Service Factor
```

### Non-Fare Revenue

```
Advertising Revenue = Static Ads + Digital Ads + Special Promotions
Retail Revenue = Rent + Commission + Services
Total Revenue = Fare Revenue + Non-Fare Revenue
```

### Government Support

```
Operating Subsidy = (Operating Cost - Revenue) × Support Percentage
Capital Grant = Project Cost × Grant Percentage
Total Support = Operating Subsidy + Capital Grant
```

## Financial Projections

### 5-Year Revenue Forecast

```
Year N Revenue = Year (N-1) × (1 + Growth Rate) + New Services
Cumulative Revenue = Σ(Annual Revenue)
Net Present Value = Σ(Annual Revenue / (1 + Discount Rate)^N)
```

### Cost Projections

```
Annual Cost Increase = Base Cost × (1 + Inflation Rate)
Efficiency Savings = Base Cost × Efficiency Factor
Net Cost = Annual Cost Increase - Efficiency Savings
```

### Cash Flow Analysis

```
Operating Cash Flow = Revenue - Operating Expenses
Investment Cash Flow = Capital Expenditure + Asset Sales
Net Cash Flow = Operating + Investment + Financing Cash Flow
```

## Performance Metrics

### Financial Ratios

```
Operating Ratio = Operating Expenses / Operating Revenue
Farebox Recovery = Fare Revenue / Operating Costs
Debt Service Coverage = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service
```

### Efficiency Metrics

```
Cost per Passenger = Total Cost / Total Passengers
Revenue per Kilometer = Total Revenue / Total Kilometers
Asset Utilization = Actual Hours / Available Hours
```

### Investment Metrics

```
IRR = Rate where NPV = 0
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow
Benefit-Cost Ratio = Present Value of Benefits / Present Value of Costs
```

## Risk Analysis Models

### Sensitivity Analysis

```
Impact Range = Base Case × (1 ± Variation Percentage)
Risk Factor = Probability × Impact
Total Risk = Σ(Individual Risks)
```

### Scenario Analysis

```
Best Case = Base Case + Positive Variations
Worst Case = Base Case + Negative Variations
Expected Value = Σ(Scenario Value × Probability)
```

### Monte Carlo Simulation

```
Iterations = 10,000
Variables = [Demand, Costs, Revenue, External Factors]
Confidence Level = 95%
```

## Funding Models

### Debt Financing

```
Loan Payment = Principal × Rate × (1 + Rate)^Term / ((1 + Rate)^Term - 1)
Total Interest = (Payment × Term) - Principal
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
```

### Equity Investment

```
Share Value = (Assets - Liabilities) / Number of Shares
Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholder Equity
Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Share Price
```

### Public-Private Partnership

```
Private Investment = Total Cost × Private Share
Public Investment = Total Cost × Public Share
Revenue Share = Revenue × Partnership Agreement
```

## Budget Allocation

### Department Budgets

```
Operations = 60% of Total Budget
Maintenance = 20% of Total Budget
Administration = 10% of Total Budget
Development = 5% of Total Budget
Contingency = 5% of Total Budget
```

### Project Budgets

```
Planning = 5% of Project Budget
Design = 10% of Project Budget
Implementation = 70% of Project Budget
Testing = 10% of Project Budget
Contingency = 5% of Project Budget
```

### Resource Allocation

```
Staff Costs = FTE × Average Salary × (1 + Benefits)
Equipment = Units × Unit Cost × (1 + Maintenance)
Services = Base Cost × Service Level Agreement
```
